# React State Managers Demo

A practical demonstration of four popular React state management libraries — **Redux Toolkit**, **MobX**, **Jotai**, and **Zustand** — built with Next.js.  
This project shows how to implement the same Todo app using different managers for comparison.

## Features

- **Four implementations**: Redux Toolkit, MobX, Jotai, and Zustand  
- **Unified UI design** with Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui components  
- **Dark mode** support (system theme detection + manual toggle)  
- **Add/Edit/Delete todos and images** for tasks  
- **Async and sync todos** for demonstration  
- **Responsive layout** with mobile-friendly design  
- **GitHub link for side-by-side code comparison** to easily see differences between implementations

## Why This Project?

State management is a crucial part of React apps. This project helps developers:  
- Understand how to use various state managers in a consistent way  
- Compare different approaches side by side visually and in code  
- Learn best practices for each library  
- See the impact of using OOP (MobX) vs atoms (Jotai) vs slices (Redux Toolkit) vs hooks (Zustand)

## Tech Stack

- **React 18 & Next.js 13** (app router)  
- **Tailwind CSS** & **shadcn/ui** for styling and UI components  
- **MobX** (OOP-style)  
- **Redux Toolkit** (modern redux)  
- **Jotai** (atomic state)  
- **Zustand** (hooks-based state)  
- **Axios** for async API calls

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn`  
3. Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the development server  
4. Navigate to `/redux-toolkit`, `/mobx`, `/jotai`, or `/zustand` to see each implementation  
5. Use the Home page to switch between managers  
6. Toggle dark mode via the UI or system preference

## Folder Structure

- `/redux-toolkit` - Redux Toolkit implementation  
- `/mobx` - MobX implementation (OOP style)  
- `/jotai` - Jotai implementation  
- `/zustand` - Zustand implementation  
- `/components` - shared UI components  
- `/app` - Next.js pages and layout
